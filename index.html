   <h2> Harry Potter Review
   <p> I think most people should have read this book by now but if you didn't you should go read this book NOW!!! This fanatsy, mystery, sort of thriller, action literally makes your mind go to the wizardlyplace and once you read this you can't stop because that is how much this series is addicting!!!!!!</p>
    <h3> Adventures of Tintin
    <p> This book will take you of the adventures Tintin and his dog Snowy has and the mysteries and crimes they solve. This book is a good read for anybody who like adenture, mystery, crime, etc.
    <h4> The Uglies Triology Review
    <p> This book is confusing for some people but you would get the hang o fit ater on as you go through the series. This is a great read for people who like science fiction, fantasy, and people who are young adults/teenagers.</p>
    <h5> The Series of Unfortunate Events
Be aware!! Not meant for people who doesn't like misery in their lives. This book has misery in it and it's a sad story betwenn these 3 sibling orphans as they have to deal with their very distant uncle. People should read this if they are really interested in drama or black comedy.</p>
    <h6> Smile Review
    I think this is a series but I will review the books individually anyways.
    Smile:
    A good book. Has conflict where one has to get braces due to an accident with her friends which she didn't expect at all.
